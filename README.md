# WASTICKERS

### This is a website to download whatsapp stickers


To run, clone the project, change directory to the project directory and run... 

### `npm install`
next you run...
### `npm start`

remember to first create a folder called data inside the src folder and add the data.json file to it

That should run the app in the development mode. and it would open the url: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
